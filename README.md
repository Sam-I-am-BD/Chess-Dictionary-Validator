# Chess-Dictionary-Validator
## My first Repo

I've been reading Al Sweigart's book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python for the last few weeks. (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) At the end of chapter 5 the first project is Chess Dictionary Validator. This project challenged me to use many concepts from the current and previous chapters of the book. 

I started out writing a lot of code that checked the mechanics to verify that my code was logical. I hadn’t written many functions, so I wanted to incorporate them into the program. (and hopefully make the code look a little cleaner) I gained a better understanding of how local variables work and how to return them to global variables. I should have figured out how to use git/GitHub sooner so you can see all of the iterations I when through. Oh well, next time.

I haven’t completed this project yet. I will push the code I have so far and hopefully you can see how I finished this project. I’d really like to make some branches for incomplete validation checks and see if I can merge them. 

I made a couple of branches for the last two functions and was able to merge them. It is nice to visually see the changes I make as I go, another handy feature of github that I was unaware of. I know the last function could have come out a little cleaner. Between learning git, github, and finishing the project, I feel ready to move on to the next thing. 

It looks like the last two projects in this chapter have prewritten code and you fill in the blanks. I'll skip posting those and be back as soon as I get to a deeper project.
