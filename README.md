# Chess-Dictionary-Validator
## My first Repo

I've been reading Al Sweigart's book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python for the last few weeks. (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) At the end of chapter 5 the first project is Chess Dictionary Validator. This project challenged me to use many concepts from the current and previous chapters of the book. 
I started out writing a lot of code that checked the mechanics to verify that my code was logical. I hadn’t written many functions, so I wanted to incorporate it into the program. (and hopefully make the code look a little cleaner) I gained a better understanding of how local variables work and how to return them to global variables. I should have figured out how to use git/GitHub sooner so you can see all of the iterations I when through. Oh well, next time.
I haven’t completed this project yet. I will push the code I have so far and hopefully you can see how I finished this project. I’d really like to make some branches for incomplete validation checks and see if I can merge them.
